# Game-Turtle-Crossing
A simple Turtle crossing game using python 
This Python project appears to be a simple implementation of the classic "Turtle Crossing" game, where the player controls an object (turtle) to cross a busy road while avoiding moving obstacles (cars). The player scores points for successfully crossing the road, and the game becomes more challenging as the player progresses.
